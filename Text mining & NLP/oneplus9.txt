["Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed.

And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn\'t have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi\'s egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions.", 'Marvel films have never been for a smart audience. But turning a character like Thor and many others into a Clash Of The Titans rom-com really seals the fate of this incarnation of the MCU. There really is nothing new here save for Thors butt, which nobody ever asked for. But serves to show just how low Marvel will go for toilet humor.', "I can't be bothered typing an essay so I'll sum up:Thor is reduced to a bumbling idiot to elevate Jane and Valkyrie.Horrible CGI.Jokes that don't land.A plot not worth caring about.Forgettable set pieces.Overuse of Guns N Roses.", 'Everything is a joke, even when it shouldn\'t be, leaves the movie itself as "a joke" itself.It has too much of that rock guy Korg. A fan edit removing most of Korg will increase the rating by at least a point.Thor gets the stereotypical Homer Simpson treatment. This is apparently the god of thunder. Ugh.', "I feel like I've just watched a movie written by a bunch of school kids. They threw everything funny they could think of against the board and literally forgot everything else that makes a good movie. As a result nothing else in this movie means anything...it's a green screen completely detached from reality...", "Maybe I did hype myself too much but since it is coming from Ragnarok and Taika Waititi, I have high expectation for this movie.Chris Hemworth is great to look at. That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.", "The script is hollow and empty. The characters are weak and meaningless. Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor. Facepalm.I did not like this movie.", "I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this. This is on par with the worst of the genre and I cannot phantom who can honestly like this.', 'I am at a loss for words, it is childish but not even that. It is actually hard to put this to words.IIt is as if they wanted to try and make this a Comedy but did not even know how to make a Comedy.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene.

Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor.

I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good.

But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those. 'Thor: Love and Thunder' wasn't quite as good as 'Thor: Ragnarok' for me, but it was still a decent watch.The film is once again very light-hearted. It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.", "Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me.

I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.", 'Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn\'t have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi\'s egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking.

And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions.", 'Marvel films have never been for a smart audience.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.", "The script is hollow and empty. The characters are weak and meaningless. Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor. Facepalm.I did not like this movie.", "I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene.

Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor.

I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good.

But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those. 'Thor: Love and Thunder' wasn't quite as good as 'Thor: Ragnarok' for me, but it was still a decent watch.The film is once again very light-hearted. It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.", "Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me.

I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.", 'Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn\'t have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi\'s egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking.

And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions.", 'Marvel films have never been for a smart audience.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.", "The script is hollow and empty. The characters are weak and meaningless. Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor. Facepalm.I did not like this movie.", "I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene.

Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor.

I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good.

But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those. 'Thor: Love and Thunder' wasn't quite as good as 'Thor: Ragnarok' for me, but it was still a decent watch.The film is once again very light-hearted. It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.", "Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me.

I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.", 'Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn\'t have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi\'s egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking.

And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions.", 'Marvel films have never been for a smart audience.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.", "The script is hollow and empty. The characters are weak and meaningless. Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor. Facepalm.I did not like this movie.", "I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene.

Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor.

I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good.

But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those. 'Thor: Love and Thunder' wasn't quite as good as 'Thor: Ragnarok' for me, but it was still a decent watch.The film is once again very light-hearted. It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.", "Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me.

I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.", 'Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn\'t have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi\'s egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking.

And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions.", 'Marvel films have never been for a smart audience.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.", "The script is hollow and empty. The characters are weak and meaningless. Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor. Facepalm.I did not like this movie.", "I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene.

Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor.

I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good.

But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those. 'Thor: Love and Thunder' wasn't quite as good as 'Thor: Ragnarok' for me, but it was still a decent watch.The film is once again very light-hearted. It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.", "Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me.

I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.", 'Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn\'t have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi\'s egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking.

And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions.", 'Marvel films have never been for a smart audience.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.", "The script is hollow and empty. The characters are weak and meaningless. Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor. Facepalm.I did not like this movie.", "I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene.

Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor.

I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good.

But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those. 'Thor: Love and Thunder' wasn't quite as good as 'Thor: Ragnarok' for me, but it was still a decent watch.The film is once again very light-hearted. It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.", "Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me.

I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.", 'Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn\'t have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi\'s egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking.

And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions.", 'Marvel films have never been for a smart audience.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.", "The script is hollow and empty. The characters are weak and meaningless. Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor. Facepalm.I did not like this movie.", "I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene.

Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor.

I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good.

But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those. 'Thor: Love and Thunder' wasn't quite as good as 'Thor: Ragnarok' for me, but it was still a decent watch.The film is once again very light-hearted. It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.", "Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me.

I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.", 'Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn\'t have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi\'s egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking.

And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions.", 'Marvel films have never been for a smart audience.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.", "The script is hollow and empty. The characters are weak and meaningless. Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor. Facepalm.I did not like this movie.", "I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene.

Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor.

I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good.

But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those. 'Thor: Love and Thunder' wasn't quite as good as 'Thor: Ragnarok' for me, but it was still a decent watch.The film is once again very light-hearted. It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.", "Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me.

I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.", 'Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn\'t have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi\'s egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking.

And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions.", 'Marvel films have never been for a smart audience.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.", "The script is hollow and empty. The characters are weak and meaningless. Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor. Facepalm.I did not like this movie.", "I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene.

Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor.

I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good.

But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those. 'Thor: Love and Thunder' wasn't quite as good as 'Thor: Ragnarok' for me, but it was still a decent watch.The film is once again very light-hearted. It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.", "Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me.

I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.", 'Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn\'t have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi\'s egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking.

And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions.", 'Marvel films have never been for a smart audience.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.", "The script is hollow and empty. The characters are weak and meaningless. Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor. Facepalm.I did not like this movie.", "I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene.

Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor.

I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good.

But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those. 'Thor: Love and Thunder' wasn't quite as good as 'Thor: Ragnarok' for me, but it was still a decent watch.The film is once again very light-hearted. It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.", "Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me.

I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.", 'Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn\'t have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi\'s egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking.

And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions.", 'Marvel films have never been for a smart audience.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.", "The script is hollow and empty. The characters are weak and meaningless. Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor. Facepalm.I did not like this movie.", "I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene.

Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor.

I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good.

But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those. 'Thor: Love and Thunder' wasn't quite as good as 'Thor: Ragnarok' for me, but it was still a decent watch.The film is once again very light-hearted. It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.", "Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me.

I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.", 'Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn\'t have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi\'s egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking.

And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions.", 'Marvel films have never been for a smart audience.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.", "The script is hollow and empty. The characters are weak and meaningless. Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor. Facepalm.I did not like this movie.", "I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene.

Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor.

I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good.

But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this.

But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those. 'Thor: Love and Thunder' wasn't quite as good as 'Thor: Ragnarok' for me, but it was still a decent watch.The film is once again very light-hearted. It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.", "Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me.

I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine.

Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.", 'Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn\'t have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi\'s egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film.

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.", "Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.", 'Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine. It has got to the point where if spending your time aimlessly going through your phone for 2+ hours or watching a marvel movie is a bigger waste of time.', 'Christian Bale is great, Russell Crowe has a good moment, Hemsworth is good but this movie cannot be saved from a terrible script, bad direction and stupid humour that overstays its welcome.', "I'm a huge marvel fanboy, and hardly ever have anything bad to say to about the MCU, but this was a huge letdown. Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.", '...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There\'s too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That\'s not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.', 'First off let\'s start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif\'s arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There\'s so much of it that it isn\'t even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that\'s one of many reasons it wasn\'t enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus\' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn\'t it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn\'t they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr\'s resurrected daughter. It\'s just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok\'s mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.', "Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.", 'Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn\'t have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi\'s egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don\'t interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it\'s their parents\' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would\'ve made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth\'s family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I\'m not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I\'m merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I\'m just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I\'d ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would\'ve laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.', "Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.", 'There are so many things wrong with this film, I\'m not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor\'s costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she\'s a girl. I guess Queen wasn\'t good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor\'s clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.', "The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.", "This review will come off as very negative, but 6 stars is a positive score in my book. I had a pretty good time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, 6 stars is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving a couple animals that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or any time after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is one of the stupidest decisions...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me. You can view this as a testament to how consistently awesome the MCU has been. But I guess they can't all be great. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022)", "..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.", "This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions.", 'Marvel films have never been for a smart audience. But turning a character like Thor and many others into a Clash Of The Titans rom-com really seals the fate of this incarnation of the MCU. There really is nothing new here save for Thors butt, which nobody ever asked for. But serves to show just how low Marvel will go for toilet humor.', "I can't be bothered typing an essay so I'll sum up:Thor is reduced to a bumbling idiot to elevate Jane and Valkyrie.Horrible CGI.Jokes that don't land.A plot not worth caring about.Forgettable set pieces.Overuse of Guns N Roses.", 'Everything is a joke, even when it shouldn\'t be, leaves the movie itself as "a joke" itself.It has too much of that rock guy Korg. A fan edit removing most of Korg will increase the rating by at least a point.Thor gets the stereotypical Homer Simpson treatment. This is apparently the god of thunder. Ugh.', "I feel like I've just watched a movie written by a bunch of school kids. They threw everything funny they could think of against the board and literally forgot everything else that makes a good movie. As a result nothing else in this movie means anything...it's a green screen completely detached from reality...", "Maybe I did hype myself too much but since it is coming from Ragnarok and Taika Waititi, I have high expectation for this movie.Chris Hemworth is great to look at. That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.", "The script is hollow and empty. The characters are weak and meaningless. Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor. Facepalm.I did not like this movie.", "I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.", 'Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I\'m shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn\'t have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren\'t even funny, it\'s like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don\'t care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.', 'I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this. This is on par with the worst of the genre and I cannot phantom who can honestly like this.', 'I am at a loss for words, it is childish but not even that. It is actually hard to put this to words.IIt is as if they wanted to try and make this a Comedy but did not even know how to make a Comedy. You know those episodes of your favorite TV shows that they tried to make a musical episode and how cringe it was to watch... Well that is the best way I can describe this.Save your money up for Gas and Groceries and hope Avatar is as good as we all hope.', "I sometimes feel like Taika Waititi is wasting his talents making MCU movies when he could be making great original content. But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those.
