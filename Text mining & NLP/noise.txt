DisplayNo Doubt it has Best In Class Amoled Display..  You Will face no Problems in Bright Sunlight. Its Bright and crisp.  It has 5 levels.  I Mostly use Level 1 in Indoor.  For Outside you can see it in Level 3, 4.2.  UI/Interface.It has a very Systematic and Simplified Interface.  Every Folders has a Sub Items.  Thats make this watch more easy to use.3. Vibration Motor.The Vibration Motor is Good in this watch.  It can alert you easily.4. Notification.You can See All the basic notification such as call, sms, whataapp, insta, fb etc.  Call Rejection, Silence and Quick Reply Option works great.5. SensorsOnly Heart Rate and SPO2 Sensors Works Well.6. BatteryIf you use the watch normally like, Brightness level at 1 or 2, Raise to wake up Option for 5 sec and Dont use Always on Display. Activity Mode for around 2 hrs in a day.  The watch can last for 6 days easily.It also has a Fast Charging.  I think around one & half hr.7. Extra FeaturesIt has some cool features Such as Stock Data, Calculator, Alarm & Reminder, Weather Forecast.What I don't Like About the watch..1. Step Counter SensorThe Step Counter is Inaccurate even after the software Updates.  It stuck and the final results are not correct.  I thought it was only in my watch so i placed a replacement order.  Even after that also the new watch has the same issue.Hardware is Good but Software is need to be updated again.2. It does not has a Mic & SpeakerYou can not use Voice Command directly from watch.  You need a TWS if you want a voice assistant or to answer the call.At this price point Noise should have also add watch calling/dialpad features.3. AppSometimes the App lags while sync with Sports Record.5. Sleep ModeThe sleep mode only works at Night.  It dont work in day time.  Sometimes its accurate and somtime its not.6. Calory MeterWhen you open Sports Mode for example i am doing Cycling.  The Calory data is not going to sync with the Main data of the Watch.  Kindly Merge it so that we will get the correct Calory Information.My Suggestion to Noise.Try to fix the issues such as step counter, sleep monitor, calory data in workout mode in the next update.Add Hindi Language Support.Add gesture keyboard and enable manual reply.If possible try to add a Navigation Feature that will sync with the Google Map and it will show the direction notification and other data in the watch.  It will be good for Bike Riders.ConclusionSo if you need a watch which has a good built quality, display and basic features then its a great watch.\n", '\nI had purchased this watch about a week ago. Everything is good in this watch. Touch is smooth but the only reason I am giving 1 Star to this product, Just because of bluetooth connectivity. It is disconnecting again and again in every 4-5 Mins and every time you have to reconnect it via noisefit app. Bluetooth range is even less than Half Meter.

The build quality and looks are really premium and the watch has plenty of features too. The reason for a poor rating is that there is a lot of misleading marketing around the product. The NoiseFit app is extremely buggy. The product support is very poor and most of the features provider are with undisclosed terms and conditions. The notifications given on the watch are only for the predefined applications provided in the NoiseFit app. You cannot add or remove any application in that list. Considering the price point, you should be able to get the notifications from any app you desire. The 'buddy' feature on the NoiseFit app doesn't seem to work on some devices. I tried raising the request and the response is yet to be received (after 2 weeks of raising the complaint). The sleep tracker will not track your sleep if it is less than 2 hours or if you're travelling. I bought 2 products. It's a waste of money.. the product is not good but feels a little overpriced and surrounded by false marketing. I've uploaded a video where the watch sensors are working and providing readings even if the watch is idle.\n", "\nIt's nothing like a watch but an awesome gadget. The primary funcation doesnot seem to be telling the time as there are a lot of other options available on it like tracking your health.The connectivity was so smooth that I did not feel like needing any help.The battery life is way more than comapred to other similar gadgets that we have in market.The face of the watch is similar to your phone which you can change and have anything on it as a wallpaper.The UI makes it so easy to use and understand for anyone to operate it.\n", '\nFactory packing and Amazon packing below Medicore Such high value item should have much more secured packing.Built quality finish is super. Display even more super. UI is super smooth and scrolls from one menu to another with consumate ease.But unfortunately all the features and their functions are not good. Heart rate spo2  is good almost matches oxy meter. Step and distance count gives different readings in two different hands . But in right hand its to some extent o.k when compared with dedicated pedometers. Battery charged on 13th Feb with on and off use there is still 35% power left on 2nd March . Commendable. Overall I am not unhappy. I also have honor band 6 which is a super product in this segment.Noise should try to improve performance of the features as they are charging quite a high price.\n', '\nOther than Omled display, all the features are available even in 2k noise other model. 3.5k extra for just omled display is waste of money.
